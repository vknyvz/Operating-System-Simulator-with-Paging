Operating System Simulation with Paging 
=============================================

This was a school project for an operating systems class.

### Notes ###

There are two phases of the application, SysGen and Running. <br> 

You can have multiple printers, CD-RW drives, disk units etc. You are the installer`. Program will prompt you for total size of memory and the size of a page along with other elements such as cpu count. Memory sizes are in number of words.
The OS will prompt for Long Term Scheduler for the size of the process (in words). You will get an error if the processis larger than the total memory in the system. <br> 

Use `t` to clean up the memory used by any job. <br> 
Use `m` to display system memory information and a frame table. <br> 

Use `S` to display all the information in page table for each process you ran. <br>
